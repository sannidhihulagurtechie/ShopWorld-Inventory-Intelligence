## 1. Project Title  
**Inventory Optimization and Automation for ShopWorld Retail Chain**

## 2. Background  
ShopWorld, a nationwide retail chain, was experiencing major issues with inventory imbalance. Popular fast-moving items were often out of stock, while slow-moving goods remained unsold. This was due to their inefficient manual inventory tracking and ordering system. The imbalance affected profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The company needed to improve stock accuracy, avoid revenue loss, and keep customers satisfied.

##  My Approach and Solutions

## 3. Problem Statement  
ShopWorld was using manual spreadsheets and lacked coordination in inventory processes. This led to:
- Frequent stockouts of fast-selling products
- Overstock of slow-moving items
- Lack of real-time visibility into inventory
- Poor customer experience and declining satisfaction

Fixing this was critical to boost sales, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational flow.

## 4. Project Objectives  
The goal was to automate and optimize ShopWorld’s inventory system. Key objectives included:
- Implement a digital inventory tracking and ordering system within 90 days
- Reduce manual tracking errors by at least 50%
- Improve stock availability for the top 20% of fast-selling products
- Reduce overstock of slow-moving items by 25% through predictive analytics
- Incorporate seasonal sales patterns into demand forecasting
- Streamline vendor coordination and warehouse processes to cut inventory-related costs by 15%
- Increase customer satisfaction by improving product availability

## 5. Requirement Gathering

### a. Stakeholder Engagement  
**What I did:** Engaged with store managers, warehouse supervisors, purchasing managers, and vendors.  
**Why:** To gather firsthand insights on their pain points and expectations.  
**Result:** Compiled a list of user needs such as stock alerts, real-time dashboards, and automated reorder systems.

### b. Process Mapping  
**What I did:** Created a visual flowchart of the existing manual inventory process.  
**Why:** To identify areas of error, delay, and inefficiency.  
**Result:** Discovered issues such as late updates, manual miscalculations, and duplicated orders.

### c. Requirements Documentation  
**What I did:** Captured key system requirements: barcode scanning, restocking alerts, and seasonal forecasting.  
**Why:** To ensure that the solution matched actual business needs.  
**Result:** Aligned the team on using tools like Zoho Inventory or Odoo.

### d. Scope Definition  
**What I did:** Helped define in-scope (automation, forecasting, warehouse coordination) and out-of-scope items (POS upgrades, supplier changes).  
**Why:** To keep the project focused and achievable in 90 days.  
**Result:** A well-structured scope document and clear timeline were established.

## 6. In-Scope and Out-of-Scope
